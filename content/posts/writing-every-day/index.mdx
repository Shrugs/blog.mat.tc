aaaaaaaaand... time. that's how long this whole "write once a day" routine worked. luckily it wasn't a 2020 resolution, or it'd be over much sooner than the 1 or 2 weeks i was able to (sorta) keep it up. the irony is that, with this post, i'm still technically on track.

i've decided to (gasp!) stop writing every day primarily because i don't have anything purposeful to say. if every post is going to be a shitty version of a livejournal that i bang out before the day is over, what's the fucking point? i want to give a shit about what i write, and forcing a daily cadence isn't the right move.

one good thing that came out of the "lemme write some stuff" motivations were the refactor of this blog, moving from a ruby/middleman statically generated site to a javascript/gatsby statically generated site. has anything really changed? well, no. and will this accumulate tech debt far into the future? well yes, absolutely. but did i have fun setting up the blog and configuring DNS? well no, not really.

at least it's deployed to `now`, like every other one of my side projects post mid-2019, so that's kinda nice.

the horrifying prospect of having to write something as part of my day had one major effect on my day-to-day: i thought more about those ideas and opinions that fleet through your head and — usually — into the ether. but when i'm searching for something to write about, i think about my thoughts a bit more. [yesterday's post about housing requirements](/home-requirements) comes from an instantaneous, mild annoyance at hitting my arm on a ceiling fan while taking off a shirt. i'd (intermittently) been collecting those minor annoyances every since renting an apartment in SF and decided that, fuck it, that was good enough to write a blog post on and put on the internet for unwitting passerby to learn about.

it's fun knowing that literally nobody is reading these posts — obscurity through obscurity. every time i'm struck by a pang of 'oh shit, i need to make sure what i wrote online is something i still agree with today', i'm comforted by the fact that nobody could possibly give a shit.

an empty space to semi-publicaly chuck throwaway thoughts is kinda nice. i bet this is what finstas (or rinstas? i can never keep them straight) are for. i bet this is what pseudononymous twitter accounts are for. a little void to shove garbage into and forget about it. it's like the 'sparkfile' idea — just chuck your ideas into the notebook as they happen to avoid digging your own rabbit hole.

the sparkfile, but for non-ideas. for things that need an audience to be said, but need no audience to be heard.
