i'm gonna start writing something (anything) once a day. i'm not entirely sure why i have the motivation to do this now, since i never had the motivation before and the time when i had the most motivation i didn't do it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

i'm going to write this as fast as i can with as little editing as possible. like that app that deletes your words when you stop, except less stressful.

i feel like i have something to say but i don't know what it is or how to day it. so here's hoping that a blog opens a door that lets me figure out at least one of those problems.

i figure today i'll talk about digital death

while in the passenger seat of a car crossing a bridge at 70mph i wondered what would happen if i died

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">thinking about how unprepared my increasingly self sovereign digital life is for the inevitability of death</p>&mdash; · Matt Condon (dot) (@mattgcondon) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgcondon/status/1219350815758004224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">like, everything i digitally own is locked behind passwords and private keys and brain wallets and i don&#39;t have a good plan for passing those along, not to mention what i want to happen to my social accounts &amp; other distributed data</p>&mdash; · Matt Condon (dot) (@mattgcondon) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgcondon/status/1219350816781369348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">who&#39;s working on handling digital death?</p>&mdash; · Matt Condon (dot) (@mattgcondon) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgcondon/status/1219350818983436290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and then i tweeted about it because it's 2020 and that's what we do in response to existential dread.

i think we're wildly unprepared for digital death as a society. social media memorial pages are naive and only scratch the surface of the issue. as more digital things become owned (and truly owned, in the case of crypto-backed ownership of scarce digital things) the value of our digital lives will become relevant to death

maybe the answer is KMS but james is probably right

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I feel like immortality is more achievable than a good KMS</p>&mdash; James Prestwich (@_prestwich) <a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1219352045867524096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


imo the answer is probably just a social norm & centralized meme around deadperson switches & falling back onto the traditional legal system for dying. shard you key in 2/n shards, giving n to descendents and 1 to a will executor. only allow recovery after deadperson switch is thrown. executor gives shard to descendent, key is reconstructed.
